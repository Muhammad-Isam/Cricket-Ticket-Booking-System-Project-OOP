# Cricket-Ticket-Booking-System-Project-OOP
In this repository, a comprehensive OOP based project has been uploaded, that connects to a Database using JDBC. It was a collective effort with two of my classmates to be able to come up with such a finished project.
In order to run the project, you've to be having NetBeans IDE, paste the project into it's Project directory, open the project, and then execute/run the main.
